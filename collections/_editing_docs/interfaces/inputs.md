Inputs are interfaces for different types of content. Use a different key for a different input. Use these conventions to customise the editor for your team and clients. This is used in the [Front Matter](/editing/editors/front-matter-editor/), [Data Editor](/editing/editors/data-editor/) and [CSV Editor](/editing/editors/csv-editor/).

> There are some exceptions where the value itself dictates the input (e.g. booleans)
{: .explainer}
