CloudCannon is a static site content management system (CMS). A folder of files are used as the source for a program called Jekyll, which outputs another folder of files (Output). To enable a wide range of workflows we support the following:

1. [Source Syncing](/files/source-syncing/file-upload/): Sync files from your chosen source for Jekyll to build from and have changes synced back
2. [Publishing](/files/publishing/introduction): Enable git workflows for editors
3. [Output Syncing](/files/output-syncing/introduction/): Sync the output from Jekyll to be used by another system
