Publishing allows editors to merge changes from one branch to another. You can choose to merge directly or with a pull request. Selecting a publish branch enables the publish interface for your site. This is useful for staging sites.

To connect a publish branch and enable publishing, follow these instructions:

Go to *Site Settings* / *Files* / *Publishing* and click **Add Publish Branch**.

Select the branch you want to merge into and click **Use Branch**. This will fail if there is no additional branch in the repository.

All editors will have access to the *Publish* option in the sidebar. Clicking **Publish Latest Changes** will attempt a merge from the syncing branch to the publish branch. If there are any changes pending these will be displayed below the publish button.
