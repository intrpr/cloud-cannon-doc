Bearer tokens allow you to bypass your site authentication with a secret token in your request headers.

To set up bearer tokens for your site:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Bearer Tokens* section
3. Enter a token name and click **Create Bearer Token**

You'll now need to send through an `Authorization` header to access the site. This is mostly intended for scripts or machine users. For example:

~~~bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" https://example.com/products.json
~~~
