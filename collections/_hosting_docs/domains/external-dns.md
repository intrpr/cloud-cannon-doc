> [*CloudCannon DNS*](/hosting/domains/cloudcannon-dns) is strongly recommended for sites on apex domains (no subdomain). *External DNS* relies on an A record mapped to a single server. This cannot be dynamically load balanced, reducing redundancy and increasing potential down time risk.

> If you are using **Cloudflare** as your DNS provider, you will need to configure your DNS records differently. See our guides for using a [Cloudflare Proxy with CloudCannon](/hosting/domains/cloudflare-proxy).
{: .explainer.warning}

If you want to host a site on CloudCannon, but manage your DNS records externally, you can use *External DNS*. To configure your domain with *External DNS*, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are using *External DNS*. Otherwise click **External DNS** and *Switch to External DNS*.
2. Note the CNAME and A records provided by CloudCannon.
2. Go to your external DNS provider and find the DNS settings for your domain. 
3. Set the CNAME and A records to match those provided by CloudCannon.

> The CNAME record maps your subdomains to CloudCannon servers. The A record maps your apex domain to a specific CloudCannon server.
