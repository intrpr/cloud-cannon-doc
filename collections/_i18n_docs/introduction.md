Internationalisation (I18n) in a web sense is the act of making your website more accessible to an international audience. This can be broken into two separate parts:

1. [Translation](/i18n/translation/): Serving content in the language of the viewer
2. [Geolocation](/i18n/geolocation/): Personalising content to give relevant content for the viewer's country

These are intentionally separate as a person living in a country is not guaranteed to speak the native language(s). Consider the case where a Japanese tourist is viewing a website in New Zealand (NZ). If I18n is handled with the above separation, the website would show the NZ content in Japanese.

### Why I18n?

The short form I18n, can be broken down to the following:

1. "i" (the first letter of the word)
2. 18 characters
3. "n" (the last letter of the word)

This is a form of abbreviation known as a [Numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym){: target="\_blank"}. Globalisation (G11n) is sometimes used interchangeably with I18n.
