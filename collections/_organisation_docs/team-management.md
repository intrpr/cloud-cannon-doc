After creating an organisation, your account is set up as the owner. There are 5 types of users in an organisation:

1. **Owners**\: These users have full permission as if it is their own account
2. **Developers**\: Can create sites and manage everything to do with them, can't update billing information
3. **Technical Editors**\: Can update sites with the source editor but cannot create new sites
4. **Editors**\: Can update content on sites using the visual editing interfaces
5. **External Collaborators**\: Configured on a per site basis, can be developers or editors

### Adding a new Team Member

1. Go to *Organisation Settings* / *Team*

Add the email of the person you want to share, select the Permission Level required and press **Create team member**

This will email the team member and prompts them to sign up or log in. Once logged in, they have access to all sites created under the organisation at the level specified.
