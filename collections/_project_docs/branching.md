Branching enables you and your team to create isolated versions of sites to make changes on.
Changes made on a branched site do not affect the main site until explicitly published.

Branched sites are preconfigured with the same settings as the main site when created, and have a publish workflow set up to use when changes are ready to go live.
By default, branched sites are deleted automatically after being published.

> Creating a branched site in CloudCannon also creates a branch on your connected Git repository.

### Adding a new Branched Site

To create a branched site:

1. Go to the *Projects* / *Sites* section
2. Click the **Create Site** button
3. Enter a name for your *Site*

Once created and initialised, the branched site is edited and published in the same way as any other site.
