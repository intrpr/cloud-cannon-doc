Remove all CloudCannon logos and brand it as your own.

To add your own branding in place of the CloudCannon's on [Client Sharing](/sharing/client-sharing/client-sharing/) login screens, upgrade to the **Pro** plan.

![Client sharing login screen](/images/sharing/client-sharing-login.png){: .screenshot srcset="/images/sharing/client-sharing-login.png 800w, /images/sharing/client-sharing-login@2x.png 1600w"}

To custom brand the [Client Sharing](/sharing/client-sharing/client-sharing/) login screen, upload a brand logo in *Account Settings* / *Sharing* / *Branding*.

![Account details interface](/images/sharing/client-sharing-branding.png){: .screenshot srcset="/images/sharing/client-sharing-branding.png 800w, /images/sharing/client-sharing-branding@2x.png 1600w"}

> If you do not set your brand logo, then Cloudcannon's branding will still be shown on [Client Sharing](/sharing/client-sharing/client-sharing/) login screens.
