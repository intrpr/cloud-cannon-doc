Customise the interface for your clients. You can provide documentation and support URLs. The support URL can be a `mailto:` link.

The preview URL overrides the link to the live site in the sidebar and header. It is useful for sites hosted externally or with redirects.

To change the URLs:

1. Go to the *Site Settings* / *Client Interface* section
2. Enter the desired URLs (all are optional)
3. Click **Update Client Interface**
