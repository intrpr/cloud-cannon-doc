Share your site with your clients without them having to create a CloudCannon account and use a seat on your pricing plan.

Go to the *Site Settings* / *Client Sharing* section and enter a password:

![Client Sharing](/images/sharing/client-sharing.png){: .screenshot srcset="/images/sharing/client-sharing.png 800w, /images/sharing/client-sharing@2x.png 1600w"}

Send your clients their website URL suffixed with **/update** (e.g. `https://example.com/update`) and have them enter the password. Once they've logged in, your client gets access to the [Visual Editor](/editing/editors/visual-editor/) to edit content on their site.
