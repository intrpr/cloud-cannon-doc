Sometimes there are unforeseen problems that arise in a team. This usually results in a support message to CloudCannon. These can be broken into two different categories:

* Site ownership
* Organisation ownership

We are attempting to protect all parties involved during these processes. If we are asking for proof of ownership it is well intentioned.

### Site Ownership Resolution

There isn't much we can do from a privacy perspective to transfer a site. Below is the information that is stored with a site:

* Files (Untransferable)
* Domain Name (Transferable)

We can't transfer the files but these are hopefully accessible from your end (through storage providers). The domain name can be transferred once the domain ownership is proven.

#### Proving domain ownership

To prove to us you own the domain we will ask you to add a DNS record. Once the DNS record can be validated, we can release your domain so that you can add it to your new account.

For transparency, we will send a message to the user currently holding the domain name. We will explain that another user is demonstrating ownership of the domain name, and that the domain name will soon be removed. This message will not include any specific information about you.

If the current holder of the domain contests the transfer, we will give them an extra 3 working days to prove ownership of the domain in the same way. If both parties are able to prove ownership, we can't adjudicate who should hold the domain on CloudCannon. In this case, the issue will need to be resolved through communication.

#### Recreating your site

To get your site on your new account, add your files and add the domain once transferred. All should be the same. If the old account was being used for the same sites we are happy to sort something out for the costs. This will usually be a coupon for the time remaining on the old account.

### Organisation Ownership Resolution

When someone leaves your Organisation it is best to upgrade another person in your team to an Owner. If this didn't happen, contact us and we will sort something out. Ideally, this is solved by communicating with the original owner.

#### Accessing the account through their email

Often organisation emails are used when creating an organisation account. The email might look like example@yourcompany.com. Someone within the organisation might be able to access that account. If that email account has already been deleted, we can try something else. If it still exists, use the [forgotten password form](https://app.cloudcannon.com/users/password/new) to reset the password. Change the owner and remember to be respectful.

#### Manual resolution

If CloudCannon needs to manually transfer organisation ownership, we will first validate that the request is valid. If the owner uses a company email, we will validate DNS access to that email. This would give us the confidence that you would be able to add or remove emails for anyone under that domain name. Failing this we will treat this on a case by case basis.
